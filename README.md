# Wireframing in UI/UX Design

## Introduction to Wireframing

Wireframing is the process of creating a basic visual layout that shows the structure of a web page, mobile app, or software interface before any detailed design or development begins. It helps designers plan how content and features will be arranged and interact on the screen.

Wireframes are usually created in the early stages of a project to help:
- Visualize the layout of content and features
- Organize information clearly
- Show how users will interact with the interface

## Why Wireframing Is Important

Wireframing is important because it:
- Helps identify potential design or usability issues early
- Saves time by avoiding rework during development
- Improves communication between designers, developers, and stakeholders
- Focuses on functionality and user flow before final visuals

Using tools like Figma, designers can create wireframes that evolve into clickable prototypes, making it easier to test and improve the user experience before coding begins.
