# Wireframing in UI/UX Design

## Introduction to Wireframing

Wireframing is the process of creating simple, visual layouts of a web page or app to represent its structure and functionality before any actual design or development begins. It is like the blueprint of a building, showing where each element (like buttons, images, menus, etc.) will be placed.

Wireframes are used early in the design process to plan content, layout, and user flow. They help teams and stakeholders visualize how a user will interact with the system, identify potential problems, and make decisions before investing time in development.

By using wireframes, designers and developers can communicate ideas clearly, reduce misunderstandings, and save time by solving issues early.
